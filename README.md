# Motes
### What is "Motes"?
Motes is a personal project initiatied in Summer 2021, it all started with the idea of having a global notes app where you can keep all of your notes from your laptop, PC, tablet, phone on only one website, an interesting thing about this website is that everyone who has the key code of your room can see your notes, this help you to share your notes with others, and you don't need an account.

### Why I started this?
I think there is probably a lot of website that are similar to my idea but I wanted to make something on my own with my own creativity and this is something that I need, most of the time I have a notepad with notes on my laptop and if I want to copy an essay or something else to my phone, I have to use different methods. This is something just for me but if you want to use it, just go on the website.

### Coding journey
The first version of the website has been completed, you can preview the website at: https://tudorale.github.io/motes/#/, small updates and features may appear but the project is finished/over.
